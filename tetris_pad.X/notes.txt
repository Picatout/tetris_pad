==========
reordering tasks in isr
removed get_next_word from get_nibble, was never called.
actual size: 1031i
My optimization efforts will end here. I can't expect gaining
more than a few instructions.

2016-12-19
===========
inlining clear_pixel, set_pixel and get_pixel,clear_screen


2016-12-18
===========
optimizing for size:
size before: 1084 prog. words
inlinining: game_init, tetris and game_over
converted pause macro in sub routine
actual size: 1070 prog. words
----------------------------------
corrected bug in drop_tetrim
actual size 1072
-----------------------------------
optimizing for size
hline routine inlined in game_init
modified vline
actual size 1053

2016-12-17
==========
bug correction in print_char and print_row
removed y bounds check and x right bound check in xor_row
-------------------------
modification to graphics fonctions
added bitmap  integrated print_row inside bitmap
modified print_char, print_tetrim and coding of bitmaps table
added feature to disable intro music by pressing button B
actual size: 1108 code words.
-------------------------------------------
modification in game loop
discovered occasional bug where drawing fail to undraw properly. 

2016-12-16
==========
modified  print_int to accept only y as argument
modified game_over:  drop down all well rows
optimizing for size reduction
to do: modified collision flag logic introduced a regressive bug

2016-12-15
==========
added set_yptr
modified video_serialize and set_video_ptr
renamed set_video_ptr set_pixel_ptr
factorisation: created set_yptr
removed mult6, mulitplication integrated in set_yptr
added game_over
this version is completed
to do: looking for further size optimization.

2016-12-14
==========
bug corrected in slide_down
slide_down renamed drop1
modification to bitop
game logic completed
beginning optimisation for size reduction
various modification to code

to do:  get rid of rot macro 

2016-12-13
==========
working on game logic
added coll_test
added count_full
to do: bug in slide_down

2016-12-12
==========
modified tasks selector in isr
modified bitop, added TEST_OP
modified get_pixel, now using bitop with TEST_OP
added SET_OP operation to bitop
added slide_down

2016-12-11
===========
modified schematic
renamed project
rework on read_pad
rework on xor_row

2016-12-10
